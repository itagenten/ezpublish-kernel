# Backwards compatibility changes

Changes affecting version compatibility with former or future versions.

## Changes

* Doctrine is now used instead of Zeta Database for legacy storage engine.
  **Semantic configuration for database settings has changed.**
  It is now mandatory to configure a Doctrine connection (see DoctrineBundle configuration), and a repository:

  ```yaml
  doctrine:
      dbal:
          default_connection:       default
          connections:
              default:
                  dbname:           Symfony2
                  user:             root
                  password:         null
                  host:             localhost
              my_connection:
                  dbname:           customer
                  user:             root
                  password:         null
                  host:             localhost

  ezpublish:
      repositories:
          main:
              # legacy => Legacy storage engine
              engine: legacy
              connection: my_connection
  ```

* New method `eZ\Publish\API\Repository\RoleService::deletePolicy` is introduced.

* Method `eZ\Publish\API\Repository\RoleService::removePolicy` will throw
  `eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Exceptions\InvalidArgumentException` in case when
  Policy does not belong to the given Role.

* User login is no longer done via legacy. It now uses native form_login.
  Legacy `user/login` and `user/logout` module views are deactivated when not in legacy mode.
  Authentication is forced in Symfony. **As such, legacy login/sso handlers won't work any more**.
  In `legacy_mode: true` (e.g. for admin interface), legacy user is still injected in the repository.

* Session name is now always prefixed by `eZSESSID`.

* `is_logged_in` cookie is not sent or used any more by Symfony stack (it is still used by legacy though).
  Anonymous state is now checked by the presence of a session cookie (prefixed by `eZSESSID`).

* **Lazy services**: `ezpublish.api.repository`, repository services (e.g. `ezpublish.api.service.content`),
  and a few others (e.g. `ezpublish.config.resolver`) are now [lazy services](http://symfony.com/doc/2.3/components/dependency_injection/lazy_services.html).
  You can now safely inject them, even in early request listeners. They will be booted only when necessary.

* **SignalSlot**: Slot factories are not needed any more as Slots are now directly attached to SignalDispatcher.
  Therefore `ContainerSlotFactory` has been removed.

* New search criterion `eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Values\Content\Query\Criterion\MapLocationDistance`
  is introduced.

* New search sort clause `eZ\Publish\API\Repository\Values\Content\Query\SortClause\MapLocationDistance`
  is introduced.

* Constructor signature of `eZ\Bundle\EzPublishCoreBundle\DependencyInjection\Configuration\ConfigResolver` has changed.
  SiteAccess is no longer injected in constructor, but with dedicated setter.
  This setter is defined in `eZ\Publish\Core\MVC\Symfony\SiteAccess\SiteAccessAware` interface, which `ConfigResolver` now implements.

## Deprecations

* Method `eZ\Publish\API\Repository\RoleService::removePolicy` is deprecated in
  favor of new method `eZ\Publish\API\Repository\RoleService::deletePolicy`.

* Method `eZ\Publish\API\Repository\UserService::loadAnonymousUser` is deprecated
  in favor of using `eZ\Publish\API\Repository\UserService::loadUser`, passing
  anonymous user ID as argument.

* Basic authentication for REST: In `security.yml, `ezpublish_http_basic` is deprecated in
  favor of standard `http_basic`.

* `ezpublish.api.repository.lazy` service is deprecated in favor of `ezpublish.api.repository`, which
  is now a lazy service.

* In semantic configuration, `ezpublish.system.<siteAccessName>.session_name` is deprecated.
  Use `ezpublish.system.<siteAccessName>.session.name` instead.

No further changes are known in this release at the time of writing.
